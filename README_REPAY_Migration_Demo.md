# Sample Data Migration Plan ‚Äì REPAY Demo

This is a sample data migration logic for transitioning a client's financial dataset from a legacy system to a new core model, modeled after REPAY's workflow. The goal is to demonstrate readiness, technical workflow, and client collaboration across a typical migration process.

---

## üß≠ 1. Discovery & Planning  
**Objective**: Understand the client‚Äôs legacy data structure, key business requirements, and any PCI/Compliance constraints.  
**Tools**: MECE-style interview questions, Figma (flow planning), AWS Application Discovery Service.

---

## üß™ 2. Validate Assumptions  
**Objective**: Ensure the source data is clean, accurate, and reflects the system we expect.  
**Tools**: Pandas, AWS Glue (schema inspection), secure CSV sampling via S3 or API.

---

## üìö 3. Client Training (Pre-Migration)  
**Objective**: Ensure client stakeholders understand how their data will be used in the new system and what changes to expect.  
**Tools**: Screenshots, walkthrough deck (Google Slides or Figma), sandbox demo access, recorded Zoom training if needed.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Execute Migration  
**Objective**: Perform transformation and migration of financial fields (e.g., renaming headers, appending ISO country codes).  
**Tools**: Python, pandas, AWS DMS for secure transfer, JIRA (task tracking), GitHub or Bitbucket (code tracking), S3 for temp staging.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Validate the Data Post-Migration  
**Objective**: Ensure transformed data matches the source on all critical fields and appears correctly in production or staging.  
**Tools**: SQL (COUNT, GROUP BY, IS NULL), Pandas verification script, spot checks with output logs, AWS CloudWatch.
