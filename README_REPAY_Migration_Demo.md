# Sample Data Migration Plan – REPAY Demo

This is a sample data migration logic for transitioning a client's financial dataset from a legacy system to a new core model. The goal is to demonstrate a technical workflow across a typical migration process IAW Amazon Web Services guidelines found here: https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/data-migration/.

---

## 1. Discovery & Planning  
**Objective**: Understand the client’s legacy data structure, key business requirements, and any PCI/Compliance constraints.  
**Tools**: MECE-style interview questioning, Figma mockups for UI.

---

## 2. Validate Assumptions  
**Objective**: Ensure the source data is clean, accurate, and reflects the formatting we are to expect.  
**Tools**: SQL/ Python Queries in Databricks.

---

## 3. Client Training (Pre-Migration)  
**Objective**: Ensure client stakeholders understand how their data will be used in the new system and what minimal changes they can expect.  
**Tools**: Walkthrough deck (Google Slides or Figma), recorded Zoom sync meetings with stakeholders if needed.

---

##  4. Execute Migration  
**Objective**: Perform transformation and migration of legacy data  (e.g., renaming headers, appending columns).  
**Tools**: Python (pandas), Salesforce (client commnication tracking), JIRA (task tracking), GitHub (code tracking), secure cloud software for actual migration (Databricks). 

---

## 5. Validate the Data Post-Migration  
**Objective**: Ensure transformed data matches the source on all critical fields and appears correctly in new core model. 
**Tools**: SQL (Validation queries), spot checks with output logs.
